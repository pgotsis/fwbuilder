<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  In addition to bug fixes and minor enhancements, v 5.2 includes the
  following new features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search for objects by port number or ip address</li>
  <li>Graphical diff viewer</li>
  <li>Diff on generated output, autocompiling firewall when loading file</li>
  <li>Support for Cisco NXOS Access lists</li>
  <li>Support for dummy objects in rules</li>
  <li>Port to Qt5</li>
  <li>New buildscript and instructions for OSX</li>
  <li>Added build instructions for Windows</li>
</ul>

<h3>Search for objects by port number or ip address</h3>

<p>
  In the library tree viewer it is possible to search for objects by
  port number or ip address. To search by port number you prefix with
  keyword 'port:', and to search by ip address, 'ip:'. This will display
  all matching objects, including groups. Some examples:
  <pre>
  Find single service
port: 80

  Find several services
port: 110,995

  Range based search
port: 25-143

  Search with limits
port: &lt;443
port: &gt;5900

  Composed search
port: &lt;24, 53, 80-110


  Find a single IPv4 address, and networks it belongs to
ip: 192.0.2.1

  Search using netmask
ip: 198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0
  CIDR notation
ip: 198.51.100.0/24

  Find a single IPv6 address, and networks it belongs to
ip: 2001:db8::1

  Search using netmask
ip: 2001:db8::/64

  Composed search
ip: 203.0.113.0/24,2001:db8::/32
  </pre>
</p>


<h3>Graphical diff viewer</h3>
<p>
  A new graphical diff viewer will show all the changes done since loading of file.
  Selection of rules are synced in the side-by-side view and double clicking a rule
  will center the rule in both the original and curent view. The diff viewer is
  activated by a new button in the upper right corner of the rule set view.
</p>

<h3>Diff on generated output, autocompiling firewall when loading file</h3>
<p>
  The user may choose an external diff utility to compare generated firewall output
  with a previously stored version. Optionally Firewall Builder can compile all
  firewalls in a project when the file is loaded. When modifying and compiling
  the user may compare newly generated firewall output with output generated from
  when the file was loaded. This feature is added to the "Inspect generated files"
  window.
</p>

<h3>Support for Cisco NXOS Access lists</h3>
<p>
  Firewall Builder now supports generating output for the Cisco NXOS platform.
  This is based on the Cisco IOS code with only minor adjustments and more
  testing is needed.
</p>

<h3>Support for dummy objects in rules</h3>
<p>
  The dummy object-feature enables the user to choose if newly inserted rules
  are added with <em>any</em> as the default target for source, destination,
  service or interface; or now: <em>dummy</em>. A rule with a dummy target will
  let the firewall compile but will not be evaluated. The user is shown a warning
  when compiling a firewall that contains one or more <em>dummy rules</em>.
  The default target is set both when you create a rule and when you delete the
  last remaining target. A <em>dummy</em> target may be "converted" to an <em>any</em>
  target. This option becomes available when right clicking on a <em>dummy</em> target.
</p>

<h3>Port to Qt5</h3>
<p>
  Firewall Builder may now be compiled with Qt4 or Qt5, with the same codebase.
  This is tested on Linux and on OSX. Note: <em>macdeployqt</em> 5.0 and 5.1 is
   broken on OSX, please see <a href="https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-32379">QTBUG-32379</a>.
</p>

<h3>New buildscript and instructions for OSX</h3>
<p>
  A new build script and instructions are added for OSX.
  See doc/README.osx in the source code.
</p>

<h3>Added build instructions for Windows</h3>
<p>
  Build instructions for Windows are added.
  See doc/README.windows in the source code.
</p>

<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed bug in the undo stack system when adding a new rule, undoing and redoing.
      The rule is now placed back in the correct group, if any, and is not corrupting
      the undo stack.
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>


<!-- ######################################################################### -->
<a name="compilers"></a>
<h2>Common changes that affect policy compilers for all platforms</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      There are now two valid return values for the compilers. In addition to the
      success return code, the compilers now return a fixed value when compiling
      a firewall with one or more <em>dummy rules</em>. This value signalizes the
      result "success with warning".
    </p>

    <p>
      The libcommon static library, and all the compiler executables, are not using
      QApplication but QCoreApplication. This removes their dependency on QtGui and 
      gives faster startup on some platforms.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>


<!-- ######################################################################### -->
<a name="other"></a>
<h2>Other changes</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed compile warning on 64 bit arch and some compile errors.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed libpng warnings: "iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile".
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>
